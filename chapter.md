# Book

Leveraging Data Science for Global Health.

This book explores ways to leverage information technology and machine learning to combat disease and promote health especially in resource-constrained settings. It focuses on digital disease surveillance through the application of machine learning to non-traditional data sources. It also explores the applications of such techniques in real world settings.


# Title: ECG Processing in Python

# Objectives

This workshop aims to introduce clinicians to popular statistical methods used in machine learning, without delving into the underlying mathematical theory.

We will discuss , as well as general concepts of model fit and cross-validation.

In the hands-on exercise, you will be asked to implement and evaluate these models on a clinical prediction problem.


No prior programming experience is assumed. Basics of the Python language and Jupyter notebook environment will be covered.


# Background


Short description of ... Jupyter Notebook






# Exercises: A set of exercises to help the reader understand the concepts. Jupyter notebooks and online materials are accepted.



# Uses and Limitations: It is important that each chapter covers both the various use cases and the limitations of the topic covered by the chapter. Ideally, we would appreciate if the authors could “connect the dots” between the chapter and the other materials in the book.
